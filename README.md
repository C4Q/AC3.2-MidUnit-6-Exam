### Animations

If you're like me (and I know you are), you must be craving for a login screen to use for authenticating Firebase users. It keeps me up at night, and I don't want to let that happen to you! So, this problem will look at adding in a series of simple animations to liven-up a login screen for our app, **Fire + Database - Data**. 

A lot of code has been provided for you so that you may focus on getting the animations just right. When you fork this repo, take a moment to look over the code that is written in `AnimationsViewController`. You shouldn't need to change anything in the sections that are marked, but you may temporarily comment out code if you find it useful to debug. Just make sure to uncomment that code before submitting your final PR.
